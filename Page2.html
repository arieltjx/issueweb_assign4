        <h4>US Legislation</h4>
        <h3>Pink Tax Repeal Act</h3>
        <p>On July 8, 2016, Speier introduced H.R. 5686, Pink Tax Repeal Act, to the House floor. The overall intention of the Pink Tax Repeal Act is to end gender-based price discrimination. She was the bill's primary sponsor. This was widely considered an early version of the bill.

On April 10, 2018, Speier introduced a revised version of the Pink Tax Repeal Act, H.R.5464. The 115th Congress (2017-2019) was expected to review the 2018 version. Skopos Labs, a technology company that predicts risks and opportunities, gave the bill a 1% chance of being enacted. The Pink Tax Repeal Act would mandate that any comparable products that are marketed toward men and women must be priced equally. Additionally, this bill was meant to target public policy as well as gendered marketing initiatives. A 2015 study done on U.S. tariff rates found that on average, even tariffs paid for women’s goods are higher than those for men.[28] Even average imported clothing taxes for men were 11.9% compared to 15.1% for women. These discrepancies were also included in the bill. Although Speier said she did not expect the bill to pass, she tried to push forward the conversation about gender-based price discrimination.

The effects of increasing women´s representation are substantial. A 10% gain in seat share decreases the pink tax by approximately 0.44%.</p>
        <h3>Gender Tax Repeal Act</h3>

        <p>While in the California State Assembly, Speier introduced Assembly Bill No. 1088, also known as the Gender Tax Repeal Act, in 1995. It was similar to the Pink Tax Repeal Act, except it focused on gender-based price discrimination in services. The bill stated that businesses such as tailors, barbers, hair stylists, dry cleaners and laundries would not be permitted to discriminate for "standard services" due to a person's gender or the gender the clothing is intended for, without a valid, prominently placed written justification. The bill passed in 2001 and remains in effect.The Equal Gender Pricing Bill was proposed in 2016 aimed at consumer goods, specifically prohibiting businesses from gender biased pricing.The main opposition argument was that a bill proposed on goods would lead to litigation, especially since the process of identifying gendered pricing remains ambiguous and subjective.</p>

        <h4>UK Legislation</h4>
        <h3>Monica Lennon</h3>
        <p>In Scotland Labour Member of the Scottish Parliament Monica Lennon campaigned to end period poverty since 2016. She introduced a Bill for an Act of the Scottish Parliament, the Period Products (Free Provision) (Scotland) Bill[37] to make provision for free period products for anyone who needs them in 2019.</p>
        <h3>Christine Jardine</h3>
        <p> An Early Day Motion directly citing the Pink tax was raised in the UK parliament by Scottish Liberal Democrat Christine Jardine in 2020 to highlight MPs concerns that women and girls pay more for basic products (including toiletries, clothes, and haircuts) than men do.[39][40] Jardine proposed The Gender-Based Pricing (Prohibition) Bill. Jardine highlights that in the UK "women on average pay £200 more annually than men for the same every-day consumer goods and services" and that in some cases the only difference is the colour of the item. </p>
